    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. **More speed:** NumPy uses algorithms written in C that complete in nanoseconds rather than seconds.\n",
    "2. **Fewer loops:** NumPy helps you to reduce loops and keep from getting tangled up in iteration indices.\n",
    "3. **Clearer code:** Without loops, your code will look more like the equations you’re trying to calculate.\n",
    "4. **Better quality:** There are thousands of contributors working to keep NumPy fast, friendly, and bug free.   "

    "The term broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. There are, however, cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slows computation.\n",
